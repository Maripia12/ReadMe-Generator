## Objective: 
To generate a README file by using node through my terminal. The command-line will accept the users input when prompted for information to generate a professional README.md with a Title section, Description, Table of 
Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests and Questions.

## Details:

* I'm then asked with more questions regarding the description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines and test instructions.

* As I type in the terminal, the information is added to the corresponding sections of the ReadMe file.
